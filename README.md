StackHub is a powerful tool that provides comprehensive, and trending insights into the open source world by analyzing +20K open repositories from GitHub.

## How it works?

 This project is powered by [@specfy/stack-analyzer](https://github.com/specfy/stack-analyser), an open-source library that parse any git repository and detects technologies from dependencies, files, folders and lockfile. We have a list of more than <strong>+600 technologies and native support for a dozen of languages</strong>. The list is manually crafted and you can contribute.
