We're excited to announce a new feature in getStack.dev: **comprehensive license tracking** across the most popular GitHub repositories. This addition helps developers and organizations understand open source license trends and make informed decisions about their projects.

Check out the [Licenses](https://getstack.dev/licenses) page to explore the data.


## Understanding Open Source Licenses

Open source licenses are crucial for the software ecosystem. They define how others can use, modify, and distribute your code. With our new license tracking feature, you can now:

- See which licenses are most commonly used
- Track license adoption trends over time
- Understand license distribution across different project categories
- Make data-driven decisions about license selection

## How It Works

Our license tracking is powered by [@specfy/stack-analyser](https://github.com/specfy/stack-analyser), a powerful tool that analyzes repositories to extract various metadata, including license information. The system performs **comprehensive analysis of thousands of popular repositories** to provide accurate insights into license usage patterns. The analysis includes license type detection, license fields in many packages declaration (e.g: package.json, composer.json, etc.), and validation of [SPDX identifiers](https://spdx.org/licenses/). This thorough approach ensures you get complete and accurate information about license usage across the open source ecosystem.

## Why License Tracking Matters

Understanding license trends is crucial for:
- Making informed decisions about project licensing
- Ensuring compliance with open source requirements
- Identifying potential legal risks
- Supporting the open source community

## Conclusion

Check out the full dataset on [getStack.dev](https://getstack.dev). Whether you're starting a new project or maintaining existing ones, this data helps you make informed decisions about licensing.
